# Setting Up

After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
Open two additional terminals in your VS code
In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.
After this, the project will be running on your localhost. Typically at http://localhost:3000/
